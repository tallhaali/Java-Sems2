## 🖥️ SystemInfo (OOP Version)

A Java-based command-line utility that fetches detailed system information like CPU, GPU, RAM, Motherboard, OS, Boot Time, and more — now refactored using **Object-Oriented Programming** principles.

### 📌 Features

* ✅ Modular class-based design using interfaces and polymorphism
* ✅ Reusable utility methods for I/O parsing
* ✅ Support for individual or full system reports
* ✅ Extensible structure for adding more components

### 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

| Concept           | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Abstraction**   | Defined a `SystemComponent` interface with a common `displayInfo()` method.    |
| **Polymorphism**  | Dynamically called the appropriate `displayInfo()` method based on user input. |
| **Encapsulation** | Utility methods and logic are neatly organized into separate classes.          |
| **Inheritance**   | All component classes implement the `SystemComponent` interface.               |

### 🔧 Components Included

* CPU Info
* GPU Info
* RAM Info
* Motherboard Info
* Disk Drive Info
* OS Info
* Java Runtime Info
* System Boot Time
* Combined Report ("All")
